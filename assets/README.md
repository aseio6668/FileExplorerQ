## Icon Files Required

To build the installer properly, you need to provide these icon files:

- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 sizes)
- `icon.png` - PNG icon for other platforms (512x512 recommended)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online converters (PNG to ICO)
- Icon editing software like IcoFX
- Command line tools like ImageMagick

For now, the build will work with placeholder files, but you should replace them with proper icons for production.
